A traditional pastiche, telling a new story in the style of Conan Doyle, with the same characters and in the same time period. Holmes and Watson receive a coded message from Mycroft, requesting their help to solve a mystery involving murders in a royal castle and a possible ghost, the italian secretary of Mary, Queen of Scots. Well written and keeps up the suspension all through the novel.</description></item><item><title>The Scroll of the Dead</title><link>http://kristoferhallen.github.io/sherlock/posts/thescrollofthedead/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 11:30:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://kristoferhallen.github.io/sherlock/posts/thescrollofthedead/</guid><description>Author: David Stuart Davies Pipes: 3/5
