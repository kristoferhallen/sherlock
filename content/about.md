## This is my Sherlock Holmes library
I write short reviews of Sherlock Holmes pastishes that I read. Mostly to make myself think about what I have read and what I thought about it and also to document my Sherlock library. I am a member of [The Baskerville Hall Club of Sweden](https://baskervillehallclub.com/).
