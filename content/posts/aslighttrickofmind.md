![A slight trick of mind book cover](/sherlock/aslighttrickofmind.jpg#floatleft) A novel about an aging and tired Sherlock has returned from a trip to post World War II Japan. The story switches between Sherlocks interaction with his housekeeper and her son, recollections from the trip and memories from an old case with a woman that he can't forget. His meeting with the woman was also the start of his interest in bees and beekeping. This novel focuses on Sherlocks struggle with being old with diminishing mental capabilities, there is very little focus on solving crime.
