**Pipes: 4/5**  
![The Italian Secretary book cover](/sherlock/TheItalianSecretary.jpg#floatleft) A traditional pastiche, telling a new story in the style of Conan Doyle, with the same characters and in the same time period. Holmes and Watson receive a coded message from Mycroft, requesting their help to solve a mystery involving murders in a royal castle and a possible ghost, the italian secretary of Mary, Queen of Scots. Well written and keeps up the suspension all through the novel.
