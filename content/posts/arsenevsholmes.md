![Arsène Lupin v/s Sherlock Holmes](/sherlock/arsenevsholmes.jpg#floatleft) There are two original stories where Arsène Lupin meets Sherlock Holmes, or Herlock Sholmes as the opponent was originally called, there are now editions that use the name Sherlock Holmes. I have a book with the story The Blond lady where Holmes is sent for to apprehend the gentleman thief Arséne Lupin. I like that Leblanc did not fall for the temptation to let his hero Lupin the smarter one that can humiliate Holmes. It becomes a struggle between two intellects that both manage to get their wins. Maybe not the best pastishe but I have to give it a high rating just based on the exitement of reading a storye where to characters from different fictional universes meet. I get the same feeling reading "Ett osannolikt möte" when [Van Veeteren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Veeteren) and [Kurt Wallander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Wallander) meet.
