![Trepiporsproblem och bagateller](/sherlock/trepiporsproblem.png#floatleft) This is a book about some scientific details of the world of Sherlock Holmes. You won't find any classical cases here but you will get detailed reasoning about things like tatoos and Chinese coins (The read-headed League). What kid of square, pierced Chinese coin could it be? If Sherlocks calculation of the train speed in Silver Blaze is reasonable and the thermo physics calculations on how fast parsley will sink in butter (The adventure of the six Napoleons). Unfortunately you can only find the book in Swedish. [Hans-Uno](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Uno_Bengtsson) was a theoretical physisist with a great talent for popular science. It is not easy to read, you need to get ready for math and physics, but it is hard not to be drawn into Hans-Unos love for the Sherlock Holmes and the enthusiasm with which he tries to explain things that Sherlock and Watson mentions only as a side note.
